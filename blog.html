								<p>The torch in Paris has been extinguished. So too, has our need for a Peacock subscription.</p>

								<p>As the Parisians begin to sweep their streets and return to normal, we can take a moment to reflect on the athletes from around the world that inspired us with their unforgettable talent and performances. From Katie Ledecky setting a new Olympic medal record to the awe-inspiring surfing competition at Teahupo’o, we are reminded of the dedication and commitment of our fellow countrymen.</p>
								<p>And, perhaps, with the pessimism of our information-saturated media diet, taking a few weeks every four years to come together in the spirit of friendly competition isn’t the worst idea in the world. As we get older and better understand the deep complexity of our global relationships, we are reminded that simplifying our similarities into a series of games can be a window through which we can experience another’s reality and get reminded that we really are all very much alike, all very human.</p>
								<p>And the opposite of human is a global media corporate empire like Comcast, the owner of NBC and the provider of Peacock.</p>
								<p>Now that we have tucked away our badminton fandom for another four years, many viewers may be considering whether to continue their Peacock subscription. Whether you're looking to save the $14 bucks a month, switch to other streaming services for the upcoming NFL season, or have watched enough of The Office, this guide will walk you through canceling your Peacock subscription. Additionally, we’ll explore other streaming options available, especially with the excitement of the NFL season just around the corner.</p>
								
								<hr class="major" />
								
								<h2>Why Cancel Your Peacock Subscription?</h2>
								
								<p>While Peacock allowed you to set one of your ‘working’ screens to tune into a portion of the Olympics referred to as ‘handball and more’, we understand that you likely won't have a reason to continue with your subscription.</p>
								
								<p>Here are our top reasons to cancel your Peacock subscription:</p>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>The Olympics is over: </strong>We’ve covered this, but if you’re like us, you’ve been a loyal Peacock subscriber for all of about 3 weeks, and it's time to go.</li>
									<li><strong>In this Economy?: </strong>Money is tight, and you already have Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and somehow a Disney+ account, so this one isn’t going to make the cut. I’d rather spend $14 on three gallons of gas than reruns of Law and Order.</li>
									<li><strong>The Catalog: </strong>We're just not interested in the content. Peacock has great content if you’re home sick and need some reruns, but we’re not expecting any Squid Game-level episodes out of this content library anytime soon.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2 id="instructions">How to Cancel Your Peacock Subscription</h2>
								<p>It’s pretty straightforward, it's not like getting out of a timeshare. Whether you’re on desktop, mobile, Roku, or Firestick, here’s a guide to get you to stop giving Comcast your dollars.</p>
								
								<h3>General Cancellation Steps</h3>
								<p>To cancel your Peacock subscription, follow these general steps:</p>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Log into Your Peacock Account:</strong> However, you’ve been logging in and watching content, do that. Here’s the <a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/watch/home?orig_ref=direct">link</a> to the main web login.</li>
									<li><strong>Navigate to Account Settings:</strong> On the website, click your profile icon in the top right corner and choose "Account." If you’re using the mobile app or Roku/Firestick, go to the "Settings" or "Account" section.</li>
									<li><strong>Access Subscription & Billing:</strong> In the Account settings, find "Subscription & Billing." This is where they tell you how much money you give them and how often.</li>
									<li><strong>Cancel Your Subscription:</strong> Click "Cancel Plan." You may be asked to confirm your decision, in case you just woke up and didn’t know how you got here. Follow the prompts to complete the process. The nice thing to note here is that they still let you use the app until the end of your billing cycle.</li>
									<li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> They’ll send you an email confirming your cancellation. Don’t worry, you’re still on their marketing lists for upcoming content!</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h3>Canceling on Specific Devices</h3>
								
								<h4>Roku</h4>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Go to the Roku Home Screen:</strong> Select the ‘Home’ button on your Roku remote.</li>
									<li><strong>Navigate to the Peacock Channel:</strong> Navigate to and select the Peacock app on your channel list.</li>
									<li><strong>Access Channel Options:</strong> Press the star or asterisk (*) button on your remote to open up the options menu.</li>
									<li><strong>Select Manage Subscription:</strong> Pick "Manage Subscription" and then "Cancel Subscription," just like the web page.</li>
									<li><strong>Confirm Cancellation:</strong> Follow whatever instructions it gives you to cancel your subscription.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h4>Amazon Firestick</h4>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Go to the Firestick Home Screen:</strong> Use your remote to navigate to the Home screen.</li>
									<li><strong>Select Apps:</strong> Go to "Your Apps & Channels" and find the Peacock app.</li>
									<li><strong>Manage Subscription:</strong> Press the Options button on your remote (three horizontal lines) and select "Manage Subscription."</li>
									<li><strong>Cancel Subscription:</strong> Choose "Cancel Subscription" and confirm your choice.</li>
									<li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> You may receive an email confirming your cancellation.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h4>Apple TV</h4>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Open Settings:</strong> Go to the Settings app on your Apple TV.</li>
									<li><strong>Select Users & Accounts:</strong> Choose your account and then select "Subscriptions."</li>
									<li><strong>Manage Your Subscription:</strong> Find Peacock and select "Cancel Subscription."</li>
									<li><strong>Confirm:</strong> Confirm your cancellation.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<h2>Alternatives to Peacock</h2>
								
								<p>If we can’t waste company time watching cyclists flip over guardrails or gymnasts flip over increasingly higher objects, where do we go from here? Baseball season hasn’t quite heated up into the playoffs, basketball and hockey are on breaks, and football is in the insufferable speculation phase. But it's not like we can watch people get sick from swimming in the Seine forever, so let’s look at your options.</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Hulu + Live TV:</strong> Our personal favorite. It's the cheapest option with the most sports and not the worst ads.</li>
									<li><strong>ESPN+:</strong> This option has pretty much all sports content, but you also get unlimited access to people arguing about non-sports things on the sports channel, so your call here.</li>
									<li><strong>YouTube TV:</strong> We love YouTube TV; it's just a bit pricey. Great option, though.</li>
									<li><strong>Paramount+:</strong> This one only made the list because they broadcast CBS, which has a lot of football games.</li>
									<li><strong>Sling TV:</strong> This is the budget option, so you kinda get what you pay for here.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
								
								<h3>Who Won the Most Gold Medals at the 2024 Summer Olympics?</h3>
								<p>The standout athlete of the 2024 Paris Olympics was Katie Ledecky, who dominated the swimming events, securing multiple gold medals and breaking records. While the USA teams typically compete pretty well in the swimming competitions, Ledecky reset the bar for the next games.</p>
								
								<h3>Can I Watch Olympic Highlights After Cancelling Peacock?</h3>
								<p>Even after you cancel your subscription, you can still access Olympic highlights in clip form on other platforms like YouTube (or Instagram reels). However, you're probably out of luck for watching an entire bicycle race.</p>
								
								<h3>Are There Alternatives to Peacock for Watching Sports?</h3>
								<p>Yes, there are several alternatives; it depends on your preferred version of grown adults playing games for money. Services like Hulu + Live TV, ESPN+, YouTube TV, and Paramount+ offer a wide range of sports content. We prefer Hulu + Live TV for the NFL.</p>
								
								<h3>Can I Resubscribe to Peacock in the Future?</h3>

								<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
								
								<p>We like the Olympics. We didn’t used to, but we’re getting old, and perhaps seeing Norwegians play badminton against South Africans gives us hope that we’re all going to be okay. Or maybe we’re just stuck in the year 2016 still. Either way, we had a great time watching these games, and we hope you all did too.</p>
								<p>We hope this guide was an informative and insightful way to navigate taking a few dollars back from Comcast and towards your next streaming purchase.</p>
								<p>See you in Italy in 2026!</p>
